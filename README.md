# Graph Dot Net

 Graph Dot Net is a web application that allows you to learn some basic concepts of graph theory or just to play around in a graph visualizer. It is built
using React and D3.js, and provides an interactive interface for creating and manipulating graphs.

## Getting Started

 To get started with Graph Dot Net, you can visit the [GitHub Pages](https://fastndead.github.io/graph-dot-net/) for this repository. The GitHub Pages
contains a pre-built bundle of the application that is not functional, but gives a general view on how the app looks and feels.

 If you want to run the actual project, here's what you need to do:
 
1. Install Git and .NET Core SDK on your machine if you haven't already.

2. Open your command prompt or terminal and clone the repository by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/fastndead/graph-dot-net.git
```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory by running the following command:
```
cd graph-dot-net
```

4. Build the project by running the following command:
```
dotnet build
```

5. Run the project by running the following command:
```
dotnet run
```

6. Once the project is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Usage

 Once you have the application running, you can use the interface to create and manipulate graphs. You can add nodes by clicking on the canvas, and connect
them by dragging from one node to another. You can also delete nodes and edges by selecting them and pressing the delete key.

The application provides several algorithms for analyzing graphs, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, and Dijkstra's
